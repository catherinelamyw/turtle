        <WhiteTextUI fontsize="16" parwidth="300" text="The whole nesting process for our turtles begins when they leave the sea to choose an area to lay their eggs. They dig a pit in the sand, fill it with 130 to 160 eggs, and then cover it. Then the hawksbill turtle will retreat back to see leaving the eggs, which will hatch in about 60 days."/>
        <WhiteTextUI fontsize="16" parwidth="300" text="This can be one of the most dangerous times of their lives.  Hatchlings make the journey from their nests to the sea. Crabs and flocks of gulls voraciously prey on the young turtles during this short scamper back to the sea and unfortunately not all of them can make it."/>
        <WhiteTextUI fontsize="16" parwidth="300" text="Juvenile sea turtles can drift in the currents for up to 10 years. They feed off small fishes, crustaceans, and jellyfishes during this time."/>
        <WhiteTextUI fontsize="16" parwidth="300" text="Sea turtles stay near the shore for about 30 years until they reach adulthood. Hawksbill turtles avoid deeper waters as nesting areas because of all the predators that roam around those waters."/>
        <WhiteTextUI fontsize="16" parwidth="300" text="The hawksbill turtles prefer near shoreline nestings due to the abundance of sponges they like to feed on. Hawksbills are named for their narrow, pointed beak that they use to extract sponges from crevices on the reef."/>
        <WhiteTextUI fontsize="16" parwidth="300" text="This is a reality for so many hawksbill turtles. Coastal developments and runoff oil spills from deep water destroy their habitats and food supply, leaving them to starve and suffocate."/>
        <WhiteTextUI fontsize="16" parwidth="300" text="Large human developments on the coasts are destroying the land and coral reefs these turtles need for nesting and feeding. It's entirely possible for a turtle to go to a shoreline one year for breeding and migration, then the next year the waters will be full of pollutants. "/>
        <WhiteTextUI fontsize="16" parwidth="300" text="Hawksbills are omnivorous and eat a variety of sea life, such as jellyfish. Due to pollution, the hawksbill may occasionally eat and choke on stray plastic. This is another reason to properly recycle our plastic correctly."/>
        <WhiteTextUI fontsize="16" parwidth="300" text="Hawksbill turtles can migrate 1000km+ in just one migration, which happens every 2 to 5 years."/>
        <WhiteTextUI fontsize="16" parwidth="300" text="Coral reefs are colourful and full of life which make them perfect feeding grounds for the hawksbill turtle."/>
        <WhiteTextUI fontsize="16" parwidth="300" text="Sea turtles have few natural predators due to their thick large shell. But humans and overfishing in tropical climates are a huge danger to them. It’s common for the turtle to be caught in stray fishing nets, taken aboard ships, and not thrown back in the water because their shells are a commodity. The legal trade of these shells ended back in 1993, but black market deals still happen today."/>
        <WhiteTextUI fontsize="16" parwidth="300" text="The catching of these turtles is such a big problem that many wildlife organizations recognize it as a main reason for their endangered status. The tropical climates these beautiful animals reside in is some of the most overfished areas with loose laws around the topic."/>
        <WhiteTextUI fontsize="16" parwidth="300" text="The shrinking population of these turtles is making it harder year and year out for them to mate. The hawksbill live a solitary life for the most part unless in migrations or mating. "/>
        <WhiteTextUI fontsize="16" parwidth="300" text="The deep water disaster is estimated to have been the cause of about 4,900–7,600 large juvenile and adult sea turtles’ deaths."/>
        <WhiteTextUI fontsize="16" parwidth="300" text="The annual rate of sea turtle deaths is about 1000 a year on average, but this is a large underestimate."/>
        <WhiteTextUI fontsize="16" parwidth="300" text="Bycatch is a huge issue for the poor turtles and some organizations have been promoting circle hooks rather than j-shaped hooks, allowing the turtles to be freed with ease."/>
