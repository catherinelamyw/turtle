    fact:"A female turtle's nesting process begins when she leaves the sea in search for an area to lay her eggs. She digs a pit in the sand, fills it with 130 to 160 eggs, and covers it. Then the hawksbill turtle will retreat back to sea. Her eggs will hatch in about 60 days."

  two:{
    page:"2",
    fact:"Moving to the sea is one of the most dangerous times of a sea turtle's life. Crabs and flocks of gulls voraciously prey on hatchlings during this short scamper back to the sea. Unfortunately not all of them can make it."
  },
  three:{
    page:"3",
    fact:"Juvenile sea turtles can drift in the currents for up to 10 years. They feed off small fishes, crustaceans, and jellyfishes during this time."
  },
  four:{
    page:"4",
    fact:"Sea turtles stay near the shore for about 30 years until they reach adulthood. Hawksbill turtles avoid deeper waters because of the many predators roaming around."
  },
  five:{
    page:"5",
    fact:" Hawksbills are named for their narrow, pointed beak that they use to extract sponges from crevices on the reef. The hawksbill turtles prefer near-shoreline nestings due to the abundance of sponges they like to feed on."
  },
  six:{
    page:"6",
    fact:"This is a reality for so many hawksbill turtles. Coastal developments and runoff oil spills from deep water destroy their habitats and food supply, leaving them to starve and suffocate."
  },
  seven:{
    page:"7",
    fact:"Large human developments on the coasts are destroying the land and coral reefs these turtles need for nesting and feeding. It is common for a turtle to go to a shoreline one year for breeding and migration, then the next year the waters will be full of pollutants. "
  },
  eight:{
    page:"8",
    fact:"Hawksbills are omnivorous and eat a variety of sea life, such as jellyfish. Sea turtles may occasionally eat and choke on stray plastic. This is another reason to properly recycle our plastic correctly."
  },
  nine:{
    page:"9",
    fact:"Hawksbill turtles can migrate 1000km+ in just one migration, which happens every 2 to 5 years."
  },
  ten:{
    page:"10",
    fact:"Coral reefs are colourful and full of life which make them perfect feeding grounds for the hawksbill turtle."
  },
  eleven:{
    page:"11",
    fact:"Sea turtles have few natural predators due to their thick large shell. Humans and overfishing in tropical climates are a huge danger to them. It’s common for turtles to be caught in fishing nets, taken aboard ships, and not thrown back in the water because their shells are a commodity. The legal trade of these shells ended in 1993, but black market deals still happen today."
  },
  twelve:{
    page:"12",
    fact:"The accidental captures of these turtles are why many wildlife organizations recognize it as a main reason for their endangered status. The hawksbill sea turtles reside in tropical climates that are some of the most overfished areas with loose laws around the topic."
  },
  thirteen:{
    page:"13",
    fact:"The shrinking population of these turtles is making it harder year and year out for them to mate. The hawksbill live a solitary life for the most part unless in migrations or mating."
  },
  fourteen:{
    page:"14",
    fact:"The deep water disaster is estimated to have been the cause of about 4,900–7,600 large juvenile and adult sea turtles’ deaths."
  },
  fifteen:{
    page:"15",
    fact:"The annual rate of sea turtle deaths is about 1000 a year on average, but this is a large underestimate."
  },
  sixteen:{
    page:"16",
    fact:"Bycatch is a huge issue for the poor turtles and some organizations have been promoting circle hooks rather than j-shaped hooks, allowing the turtles to be freed with ease."
